# Polynomial Visualization Tool

## Overview
The **Polynomial Visualization Tool** is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python's Tkinter and Matplotlib libraries. It allows users to input polynomial equations and visualize both the polynomials and their derivatives. The tool also includes functionality for plotting the polynomials, performing numerical integration, and providing an animated plot of the polynomial equations.

### Features:
- **Polynomial Selection**: Choose from different polynomial types (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, Biquadratic).
- **Derivative Calculation**: The application computes and displays the derivative of the selected polynomial.
- **Plotting**: Plot the selected polynomial and its derivative on a graph.
- **Integration**: Compute and display the area under the curve (integral) of the polynomial between a specified range.
- **Second Polynomial Option**: Option to add a second polynomial and compare the two.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Interactive buttons with hover and click effects for a modern, user-friendly experience.
- **Animation**: Animate the polynomial plot dynamically for a smooth visual experience.
- **Scrollable UI**: The tool's UI is scrollable, allowing it to handle a large number of input fields.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- `tkinter` (for the GUI)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting the graphs)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `scipy` (for integration)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
